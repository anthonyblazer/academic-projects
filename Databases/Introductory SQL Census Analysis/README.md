# SQL Census Analysis


**Name:** SQL Census Assignment  
**Description:** This assignment is an analysis of the 2000 and 2019 Cnesus data. The three provided sections give professor-curated questions that allow for the creation and use of complex queries.  
Every section's answers use PostgreSQL. Additionally, the uniquenss of this assignment comes from the assignment's open-endedness. The decisions and queries that I explain and make throughout the sections are based off my own judgement. The importance (and credit) came from how I defended my choices.
