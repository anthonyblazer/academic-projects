Find the counties with the maximum, minimum, median, 1st and 3rd quartile population 
density in 2000 and again in 2019.


    Calculations explanation
    Population density is calculated by: population / ACTUAL land area (not including water)
    This calculation will give a better picture of each county's population dispersion of actual 
    land since it is unlikely that people are residing in the water territories.

    Creating Another Table
    Note: I created a third table that's exactly like us_counties_2000 but instead I changed the name 
    of Shannon County to its current name, Oglala Lakota County. This allowed it to be included in the 
    calculations, unlike the ones you'll see in WHERE's.

        --Created new table (same syntax as us_counties_2000) ; ommited for brevity
        --New table: us_counties_pop_est_2019
        UPDATE us_counties_2000_question_3
        SET geo_name = 'Oglalala Lakota County, South Dakota'
        WHERE state_fips = '46' and county_fips = '113';
        UPDATE us_counties_2000_question_3
        SET county_fips = '102'
        WHERE state_fips = '46' and county_fips = '113';
