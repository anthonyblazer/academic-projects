# GQL 2024 Graph Based Assignment

**Background:** GQL 2024, a.k.a Graph Query Language, is a query language for property graphs and was standardized in April 2024 by the ISO/IEC JTC 1. GQL, along with other popularized graph querying langauges, is a NoSQL language, meaning that it does not follow a strict structure, allowing for intricate relationships and queries.
**Name:** GQL Graph Based Assignment
**Description:** This assignment is a implmentation of a Graph-based model in GQL 2024. 
This assignment comes with two files, GraphAssignment.java and GraphAssignment2.java in the root of the src folder in NebulaGraphExample. GraphAssignment gives an example of a complex query needed to perform a search for a certain parameter. GraphAssignment2 is an application feature that determines the least exepsnsive route between two cities based on gas prices.
Since GQL is a new language that is still not completed, our professor was able to get us access to the IDE NebulaGraph through Java's IDE, Eclipse. All qeuries that would be run in GQL are in gql_string in the java files.


**Languages:** GQL
**Data Model:** Graph
