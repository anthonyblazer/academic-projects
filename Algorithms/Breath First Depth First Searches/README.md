# BFSDFS


**Name:** BFS and DFS
**Description:** This assignment is an implementation of Breath First Search Algorithm and Depth First Search algorithms. The Graph class represents a directed graph using an adjacency matrix and supports Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal. It uses a Node class to store metadata for each node, including its name, parent, discovery and finish times (for DFS), distance (for BFS), and traversal state, represented by color constants (WHITE, GRAY, BLACK). The Graph constructor initializes the adjacency matrix, nodes, and related attributes. DFS recursively explores nodes, updating discovery and finish times, while BFS uses a queue to explore nodes layer by layer, updating distances and parents. The toString method provides a textual representation of the adjacency matrix and node details. The Node class includes getters, setters, and a toString method for managing and displaying node information.
