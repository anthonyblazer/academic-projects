# Order Statistic Tree


**Name:** Binary Search Tree with Order Statistics
**Description:** This assignment involved implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) augmented to support order statistic operations. The BST includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order), along with advanced functionality for finding the minimum, maximum, successor, and predecessor of nodes. It also supports order statistic queries such as selecting the i-th smallest element and determining the rank of a given key. The tree dynamically maintains size information for efficient rank and select operations. Additional helper methods manage node replacements and size recalculations during structural modifications. The class is generic, allowing storage of comparable elements, and provides a comprehensive suite of operations to manipulate and query the tree.
Along with the BST Augmentation implmentation is a main class to test the BinarySearchTree class and methods.
