# MaxHeap Implementation


**Name:** MaxHeap
**Description:** This implementation defines a generic MaxHeap class that represents a zero-based indexed max-heap using an array. The class supports elements of type T, where T extends Comparable<T>. Key functionalities include building a max-heap, maintaining the heap property, and sorting the array using heapsort. The class provides methods to construct a heap from an array, print the heap, and access child nodes. It ensures heap integrity through operations like maxHeapify and element swapping. The heapsort algorithm rearranges elements in ascending order while preserving the original heap size. 
Along with the MaxHeap implementation is a main class that tests the MaxHeap class and methods.
